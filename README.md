# CS346 - Scrappy Notes

## Goal
A note-taking application which encourages users to store their fleeing thoughts and ideas in a chaotic yet organized way.
It includes common notes features such as adding, editing, deleting notes, as well as ways to organize/search them.

Our application includes both a GUI and a simple console interface.
